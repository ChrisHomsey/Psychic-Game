# Psychic-Game

The Psychic Game was my second project in the **CWRU Coding Bootcamp**. The idea was to make a single-page web app that the user could interact with.

The idea was for the user to guess a letter that the application has chosen at random. Each round, the player is allotted **9 guesses**. Each time the player presses a key, the input is recorded and matched to the correct answer. If the player fails to guess the correct letter in 9 tries, the round is recorded as a loss. If the player succesfuly guesses the letter, his win is recorded and a new round begins.

It was built with simple HTML markdown and JavaScript. jQuery was used to target the elements.

*This simple app was a great way to start with JavaScript and build something small, but with multiple functions that are repeatable.*
